ClowCards-Haskell
===============

An implementation of a browser-based Heroscape random card drafter, with the server in Haskell and the client code in PureScript.

This project is essentially a Scala => Haskell, CoffeeScript => PureScript port of [this project of mine](https://github.com/TheBizzle/ClowCards).
