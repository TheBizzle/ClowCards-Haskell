ClowCards-Haskell
===============

An implementation of a browser-based Heroscape random card drafter, with the server in Haskell and the client code in PureScript.  The PureScript ecosystem is in its infantile stages as I'm doing this, and there's quite a bit of flux, so don't be surprised if something doesn't work particularly well on your system.

This project is essentially a Scala => Haskell and CoffeeScript => PureScript port of [this project of mine](https://github.com/TheBizzle/ClowCards).
